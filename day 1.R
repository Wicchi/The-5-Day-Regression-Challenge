# That blue line we've plotted is actually a regression model! Looking at the regression line,
# we can tell that as the number of calories in a recipe increases, it's more likely that that 
# recipe is a dessert. 
# (We can tell this because the line moves towards 1, which means "is a dessert" and away from 0, which means "isn't a dessert")

# now let's try to work with weather datasets. 
# I'll try to predict temperature based on wind speed

# Unfortunately, as we can see the wind don't have any effect on temperature
# and we can predict temperature based on wind

# Now let's start working with bicycle 
# Question, can we predict amount of rider depend on temperature

# As we can see, then temperature is increasing the total is increasing too.
